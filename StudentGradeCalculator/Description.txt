This Java program, StudentGradeCalculator, calculates and displays the final grade for a student based on scores from three components: TMA (Tutor Marked Assignment), MTA (Midterm Assessment), and Final Exam. Each component contributes a specific percentage to the final grade. The program performs input validation, calculates weighted scores, determines the final letter grade, and prints the results.
